## Simulation (MuJoCo, real actuator limits)

**2/2 task tests pass.** Every motor is limited to its datasheet peak torque and its torque-speed line, with the rotor inertia reflected through its gearbox; continuous loads are compared with the rated torque. The animation above is recorded from these tests.

| | Test | Result |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | stand free | base z 0.005 -> -0.001 m (creep after settling 0.0 mm), upright 1.000; no continuous ratings known; worst leg joint at 0.02x peak |
| ✅ | squat | free standing: commanded body drop 40 mm (20 % of 202 mm leg), achieved 40 mm, back up to 40 mm above the low point, upright 1.000 |

_PASS means the modelled actuators (datasheet peak torque as a hard limit, a linear torque-speed line to no-load speed, reflected rotor inertia, URDF damping/friction) can produce the torques and speeds the task needs in this geometry and mass distribution, and that mean torque over the hold stays within the continuous (rated) torque. Joint control uses an ideal model-based feedforward (computed torque) through the force-limited servo for fixed-base robots and plain position servos for floating robots; a pass therefore proves torque/speed capacity, not that a given controller achieves it. Untested: thermal limits over long duty cycles (only the mean-vs-rated proxy), gearbox backlash and compliance, link and joint flexibility, encoder resolution, supply voltage sag and current limits, bus latency, controller tuning, and contact/friction values (nominal friction only)._
